<h3>Description</h3>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ohhhh nooo!! IMDB just went down. Luckily we heard that you could help to provide a <code>service</code> while IMDB's DevOps team gets the website back online.</p>
<p>You will create a backend API to allow a user to search for a movie search by genre.
What is a backend? What is an API?
These two questions might require some googling to grasp the concepts before starting the project. :-)</p>
<p>We will provide you with a <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-ds/imdb-movie-data.csv" target="_blank">CSV</a> file.
This file contains more than one thousand movie titles. One of the columns marks the genre for each movie.</p>
<p>Your backend will receive a requested genre and will only <code>serve</code> movies with the corresponding <code>genre</code>.
Example:
The client requests all Action movies.
Your backend should parse the CSV, filter by the genre `Action and reply with a list of Action movies, while also respecting the HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>For this project you will be able to use a <code>framework</code> to take care of the HTTP communication protocol.</p>
<h2>Technical Description</h2>
<p>Create a backend app with a light web framework. (For python we recommend using <code>flask</code>.)
It will <code>listen</code> on port 8080.</p>
<p>All your routes will answer in <code>JSON</code> format!</p>
<p>You don't need to create a database, just parse the provided <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-ds/imdb-movie-data.csv" target="_blank">CSV</a>.</p>
<p>Your backend will serve six <code>routes</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GET</code> on <code>/</code>
This route will parse the GET parameter <code>genre</code>, to be able to filter by movie genre.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example on how to access this route:</p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">curl "http://localhost:8080?genre=action"
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GET</code> on <code>/action</code>
This route will only serve action movies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example on how to access this route:</p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">curl "http://localhost:8080/action"
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GET</code> on <code>/adventure</code>
This route will only serve adventure movies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example on how to access this route:</p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">curl "http://localhost:8080/adventure"
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GET</code> on <code>/comedy</code>
This route will only serve comedy movies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example on how to access this route:</p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">curl "http://localhost:8080/comedy"
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GET</code> on <code>/drama</code>
This route will only serve drama movies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example on how to access this route:</p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">curl "http://localhost:8080/drama"
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GET</code> on <code>/romance</code>
This route will only serve romance movies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example on how to access this route:</p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">curl "http://localhost:8080/romance"
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">[my_imdb_api/]curl "localhost:8080?genre=western"

<p>You can also write a section inside your README.md on <code>how-to install your app</code> and how to run your app.</p>
<h3>How can I access my docode server from the browser?</h3>
<p>1 -- Open your server
Make your server <code>listening</code> on 0.0.0.0
And make sure the listening port is <code>8080</code></p>
<p>2 -- Your server will be accessible at this URL:
XXXXXXXXX is your docode ID
http://web-XXXXXXXXX.docode.YYYY.qwasar.io</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">If your docode url is:
abc123.docode.us.qwasar.io
then your url will be:
http://abc123.docode.us.qwasar.io
